# basic-noise-prediction-filters
Here are some basic filter designs for noise predictions, every filter will be compared against the ideal linear estimator.

The noise process will be the same in all of the filters, an AR process with an added white gaussian noise.

Due to the fact that it is hard to write equations in this README file, I encourage you to look in the added pdf for further explanations.

All of the filters will be simulated in MATLAB. 

The filters here are based on one of my exercises from applied signal processing course
